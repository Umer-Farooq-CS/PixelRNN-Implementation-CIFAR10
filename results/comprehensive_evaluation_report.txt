KEY FINDINGS
--------------------
• Best Performing Model: DIAGONAL_BILSTM
  - Achieved lowest NLL of 5.476352
  - Achieved lowest bits per dimension of 0.001783

• Performance Gap:
  - NLL difference from second best: 1.053740
  - Bits per dimension difference: 0.000343

TECHNICAL NOTES
--------------------
• All models were trained on CIFAR-10 dataset (32x32x3 images)
• Evaluation metrics include negative log-likelihood and bits per dimension
• Generated samples were evaluated for quality and diversity
• Lower NLL and bits per dimension indicate better model performance
• Composite score combines both metrics for overall ranking

RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------
• Use DIAGONAL_BILSTM for best overall performance
• Consider computational efficiency vs. performance trade-offs
• Further hyperparameter tuning may improve results
• Consider ensemble methods for even better performance
